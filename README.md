### EasyJsonApi
Don't know what request and response should use? 
Maybe JsonApi turns your life more easy, use the EasyJsonApi and forget the problems.

The EasyJsonApi has been creating because we don't have many possibilities when we need to create generic requests or responses for our services. The specification [jsonapi](http://jsonapi.org/) helps us to follow rules and guidelines for our API; however, you need to create and mapping the objects, unfortunately you lost a lot of time if you want to use that standard inside various projects. The EasyJsonApi improve the way how you create the structure and mapping the objects, it will try to make easy, funny and practice your implementation.

### Limitations:
* The API only works in JAVA language,
* It is in BETA version,
* Low people contribution.

### Good things:
* Follow the [jsonapi](http://jsonapi.org/) specification,
* OpenSource project.
